# Overview

### Blockchain technology can only realize its full potential when it gains parity with centralized technology.

Despite rapid innovation, blockchain technology still has ways to go, towards supporting the transaction volumes, speed, or data storage required for decentralized platforms to rival today's centralized giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.&#x20;

Current blockchains struggle with balancing decentralization, security, and scalability all at once within a single chain. This severely limits the viability of decentralized apps to provide the performance and user experience to disrupt major consumer markets like social media, gaming, entertainment, and productivity tools.&#x20;

IPC was conceived from the [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/what-is-filecoin) project and has since expanded its roadmap to support multiple chain networks. As with many other blockchain networks, including Filecoin, consensus requires that all validators process all transactions. This creates a bottleneck and IPC was designed to increase network performance by scaling out.

### **InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC) is a transformative blockchain technology that brings planetary-scale performance for the first time to web3.**&#x20;

IPC enables on-demand horizontal scalability of networks, by introducing "subnets".&#x20;

These subnets are self-governing chains that spawn their own state, validate messages in parallel, and seamlessly interact with any network in the hierarchy, including the root network of choice. Subnets can run different consensus algorithms, depending on application requirements.&#x20;

IPCâ€™s modular runtime enables the creation of lightweight and flexible blockchains, adaptable to various platforms such as web browsers or mobile devices.&#x20;

Moreover, IPC-powered networks can dynamically adjust their throughput by spawning and closing temporary subnets as needed.
