# Welcome to IPC Docs

**IPC is the next frontier in blockchain scalability, unlocking unmatched capacity and enabling new use cases.**

Consensus poses a major scalability bottleneck in blockchain networks. This is particularly the case when all validators are required to process all transactions, as is the case for Filecoin, which prevents the network from increasing its performance by adding more participants (scale-out).

Moreover, not every application benefits from using the same consensus algorithm: different applications may have different performance and security requirements, making it difficult for a single blockchain network with a single consensus layer to accommodate any web3 application.

Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) is a framework to enable on-demand horizontal scalability of Filecoin by deploying subnets (self-governing chains) that spawn their own state, validate messages in parallel, and seamlessly interact with any network in the hierarchy, as well as with the Filecoin root network. Subnets can run different consensus algorithms, depending on application requirements.

IPC is complementary to the programmability introduced by FVM: it provides a framework to further program the Filecoin network, accommodating a variety of use cases while overcoming potential consensus bottlenecks, to load balance decentralised applications by spawning new blockchain substrates on-demand, and to tailor the system to better fit application needs.
