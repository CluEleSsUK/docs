# Testnets

### Canopy IPC public test subnet

Canopy is a publicly available IPC subnet that functions as a test network for applications to deploy smart contracts to. Its rootnet is the Filecoin Calibration net.&#x20;

### IPC local subnet

To test your application in a local environment, you can set up a standalone local testnet by following the quickstart on deploying a subnet, without connecting it to a parent network. The local subnet will not derive the Genesis block from the parent network and requires some additional manual setup.

### Filecoin Calibration network

The Calibration network is the most realistic testnet simulation of the Filecoin mainnet.&#x20;

As the largest decentralized storage network, applications that require data storage and retrieval, can leverage Filecoin's storage capabilities by connecting an IPC subnet to Calibration net as the parent network.&#x20;
