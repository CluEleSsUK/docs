# Chain compatibility

### Chain compatibility

While IPC subnets can resemble other L2 platforms, such as [Optimistic rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/), [Zero-knowledge rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) or a [sidechain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/) with a native communication bridge, IPC subnets are specially designed to be compatible with multiple networks.

IPC is currently fully compatible with the [Filecoin network](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/what-is-filecoin) and [EVM-compatible networks](https://chainlist.org/). Compatibility with more chains is in the [roadmap](https://ipc.space/#roadmap).&#x20;
