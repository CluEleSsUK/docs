# Applications of IPC

IPC [load balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load\_balancing\_\(computing\)) decentralized applications (dApps) by spawning new blockchain subnets on-demand, and to tailor the system to better fit application needs.&#x20;

Here are some examples of how IPC improves the performance of dApps:

* **Distributed Computation**: Spawn ephemeral subnets to run distributed computation jobs.
* **Coordination**: Assemble into smaller subnets for decentralized orchestration with high throughput and low fees.
* **Localization**: Leverage proximity to improve performance and operate with very low latency in geographically constrained settings.
* **Partition tolerance**: Deploy blockchain substrates in mobile settings or other environments with limited connectivity.

With better performance, lower fees and faster transactions,  IPC can rapidly improve horizontal and vertical markets with decentralized technology. Examples include:

* **Artificial Intelligence:** IPC is fully compatible with [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/what-is-filecoin), the worldâ€™s largest decentralized data storage. Leveraging Filecoin, IPC can enable distributed computation to power hundreds of innovative AI models.
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Enabling truly high-frequency trading and traditional backends with verifiability and privacy.
* **Big Data and Data Science:** Multiple teams are creating global-scale distributed compute networks to enable Data Science analysis on Exabytes of decentralized stored data.
* **Metaverse/Gaming:** Enabling real-time tracking of player interactions in virtual worlds.
* **DAOs:** Assemble into smaller subnets for decentralized orchestration with high throughput and low fees. Partition tolerance: Deploy blockchain substrates in mobile settings or other environments with limited connectivity.
